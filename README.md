# Voice-Assistant-Python

In this modern era, day to day life became smarter and interlinked with technology. We already know some voice assistance like google, Siri. etc. 
Now in our voice assistance system, it can act as a basic medical prescriber, daily schedule reminder, note writer, calculator and a search tool. 
Today the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can organize a natural human-machine interaction 
(through voice, communication, gestures, facial expressions, etc.) are gaining in popularity. 
One of the most studied and popular was the direction of interaction, based on the understanding of the machine by the machine of the natural human language. 
It is no longer a human who learns to communicate with a machine, but a machine learns to communicate with a human, exploring his actions, habits, 
behavior and trying to become his personalized assistant. Virtual assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks, 
such as showing weather reports, creating remainders, making shopping lists etc. They can take commands via text (online chatbots) or by voice. 
Voice-based intelligent assistants need an invoking word or wake word to activate the listener, followed by the command. 
We have so many virtual assistants, such as Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. This system is designed to be used efficiently on desktops. 
Personal assistants software improves user productivity by managing routine tasks of the user and by providing information from an online source to the user.
This project was started on the premise that there is a sufficient amount of openly available data and information on the web that can be utilized to build 
a virtual assistant that has access to making intelligent decisions for routine user activities.
